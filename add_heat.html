    <h1>Additively Manufactured Heat Sinks for High-Reliability Applications</h1>

    <div class="content-section">
        <p>In high-reliability extreme environment electronics applications such as built-in temperature and vibration sensors for turbine blades, there has been a push to produce higher feature densities capable of more on-board computation. This computation generates heat, which needs to be removed and transferred to a working fluid, such as air or a dedicated cooling fluid.</p>
        
        <p>To both increase the surface area of the pins and improve manufacturability, we designed additively manufactured hybrid DLP and metal electroformed heat sink pins for these environmental applications. The design includes a reliable sensitization and electroforming technique for plating printed pins.</p>
